# BBGM-NBA-Info
The JSON for Team Info and Player Photos for BBGM.

Go to https://play.basketball-gm.com/options and paste the contents of the teaminfo.json file into the Team Info box on BBGM, and do the same for the Player Photos.

All the photos are done, but these are all of Basketball Reference photos. If they don't have a photo, then it isn't on here.

All team logos work aswell now, and they change over the years.

If there are any errors (like a missing photo for a player or team, wrong photo, missing logos), let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/mamamia5x/BBGM-NBA-Info/issues) page. If you found a better image and want me to put it in, also put it in the [issues](https://github.com/mamamia5x/BBGM-NBA-Info/issues) page. If you already put the images in, create a pull request at [pull requests](https://github.com/mamamia5x/BBGM-NBA-Info/pulls).
